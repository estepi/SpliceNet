Scripts associated to transcriptome-wide analysis of the effects of systematic knock down of splicing factors and regulators using siRNAs in HeLa cells

# Description

To  systematically  explore  the  functions  of  core  splicing  factors  and regulators  in  alternative  splicing,  RNA-seq  analyses  were  carried  out  upon  the knockdown  of  over  304  splicing-related  factors.
